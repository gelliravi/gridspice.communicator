To start demo:

1) Make sure rabbitmqserver is running:
   ~/rabbitmq-server-2.8.7/scripts/rabbitmq-server
2) Run init.sh script
3) Run receive.sh script in one terminal.
4) Run middleman.sh script in another terminal.
5) Run send.sh in another terminal.

send.sh forks a process that sends a message to the middleman process, which
then replicates the message and sends these to the receive process.
